I provide small to medium-sized software support to software companies in Istanbul. While working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I also manage IT processes such as server and hosting management.  

In projects, I contribute to software development and technical infrastructure management by offering customized solutions tailored to clients' needs. Additionally, I provide support in server configuration and hosting services.
